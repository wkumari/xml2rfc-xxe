xml2rfc-xxe
============

### A configuration to assist editing xml2rfc-format documents using XMLMind XML Editor.
> ☝️ xml2rfc-xxe does not (currently) support [Version 3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rse/format-faq/#14) format. Pull Requests / help fixing this would be appreciated. See https://github.com/wkumari/xml2rfc-xxe/commit/0e8049e74a74655545303ff07fcd48e09c640721 for some background. For now, you can stick  with v2 rfc2xml, which works just fine as an editing format, and then convert to v3 rfc2xml before submitting each draft revision.

Make sure you download and install XMLMind XML Editor first.
This configuration works with both Personal and Professional editions.
Some features (e.g., format using XSLT) only work with Professional edition.

This is a WYSIKN ("What You See Is Kinda Neat") addon for the very configurable XMLMind XML Editor (“xxe”).
The personal version of xxe is free and very capable. It's also written in java, so one addon works on many 
platforms (I've tested it on MacOS, Windows 2000 and FreeBSD).

The addon is capable of graphical editing of sections, anchors, lists, cross-references, etc.
and allows word processor-like behavior of "enter" to create a new paragraph or list item.
It can use a locally-installed xml2rfc to format the document for preview or conversion, 
or use xxe's built-in XSL transform or submit the document to the xml.resource.org web form. 
It provides easy hooks to validate the references to other IETF documents in your document to make sure they're up to date.


Note: This project was migrated from Google Code (https://code.google.com/archive/p/xml2rfc-xxe/) -- we have not really maintainted it after this.
Prerequisites:

- For building java help:
  xsltproc (and libxml2)
  docbook-xsl style sheets
  javahelp-2.0 (possibly earlier)

- As there is no Makefile for the xml2rfc.jar file I simply copied if from
  a previous version.
