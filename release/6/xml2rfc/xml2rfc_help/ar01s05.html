    processing instructions more easily is planned, support for handling the
    file that is included is not - meaning that, for example, although
    cross-references to a reference in the included file now show as
    "included", the xxe validator will claim that the document doesn't
    validate.</p><p>xxe is by nature a "root element editor", not an XML file editor, so
    the ability to edit processing instructions that occur before the root
    &lt;rfc&gt; element is provided by custom java code. It supports editing
    any &lt;?rfc ...?&gt; PI before the root element; it provides a dropdown
    box for PIs that it knows about but the PI name can be typed in if the
    dropdown box doesn't contain the desired element name. Although PIs with
    multiple pseudo-attributes can not be edited, they will not be damaged.
    For example, &lt;?rfc toc="yes" toccompact="no"?&gt;&#8212;this will appear in
    the editor the same as &lt;?rfc toc="yes"&gt;.</p><p>In addition, the <span class="guimenuitem">Edit in...</span> menu option
    facilitates editing these items in another editor.</p></div></body></html>
