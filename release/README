Google Code downloads don't believe in replacing an existing file.
Therefore, the .xxe_addon file has to live here.

This hierarchy is accessible at
http://xml2rfc-xxe.googlecode.com/svn/release/...
and the zip files are at
http://xml2rfc-xxe.googlecode.com/files/...
so the addon file has to have a full URL in it.

Google Project Hosting no longer allows uploading files (into the Downloads section), so I'm just copying (using the "Upload" option in the "Browse" section) the zip file here. Suboptimal, but...
