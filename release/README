In order to support both XXE 5.x.x and 6.x.x we now have 2 directories - release/5/ and release/6/.

Running 'make' in the trunk branch *should* create trunk/dist/5/ and trunk/dist/6/.
Each of these should have (at least!) a xml2rfc-xxe-<plugin_version>.zip and a xml2rfc.xxe_addon file.
The xml2rfc.xxe_addon file *should* have the:
1: correct URL for the major version of XXE and plugin version.
2: the correct XXE Major version
3: the correct plugin version.

Copy these into this release branch:
cp -a ../trunk/dist/5 ../trunk/dist/6 .

and then submit.
