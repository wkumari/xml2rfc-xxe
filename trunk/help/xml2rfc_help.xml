  <title>xml2rfc Support</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>This xxe plugin attempts to support most of the rfc2629bis DTD, as
    of November 10, 2004. The following items are not yet supported:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>texttable. This requires some extra help (probably a custom java
        widget) to style the table for xmlmind.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>&lt;?rfc ?&gt; processing instructions in general. &lt;?rfc
        include= in particular.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The RFC's description of &lt;list&gt; specifies that style is
        inherited from nearest parent; DTD says that it defaults to empty. The
        editor currently uses the DTD definition; java might be able to help
        implement the other way.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Planned features:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Make toolbar helpers more useful</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Revisit HTML preview</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Try to use xsl instead of tcl for the HTML output, since xxe has
        native xsl support?</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>For now, you still have to know a fair amount about the xml2rfc
    schema to use this tool.</para>

    <para>Enter and backspace can be used as you might expect a word processor
    to behave when you're editing paragraphs or lists.</para>

    <para>To insert sections, paragraphs, figures, cross-references, etc., use
    the toolbar or the XXE insert pane; you'll commonly use "Insert" and
    "Insert After".</para>

    <para>Lists, paragraphs and sections are inserted after/inside the current
    one depending on the XXE selection; generally a new element is inserted
    after the current one if the current one is selected, or at the easiest
    place inside the current one if the mark is inside the current
    element.</para>
