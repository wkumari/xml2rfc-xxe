= Caveat =

I'm less likely to support this.  If you want to install a supported release you may have to delete this url from the addon manager.  (On the other hand, this is the only possible method now so hey)

= How To =

Drag this link, or add it by transcribing it, into the "Download add-ons from these servers" addon manager configuration (*Options* menu -> *Preferences...* item -> *Install add-ons* pane): http://xml2rfc-xxe.googlecode.com/files/xml2rfc-0.7.3-beta4.xxe_addon. Then go to the addon manager (*Options* menu -> *Install Addons...*) and you will see the xml2rfc configuration in the list of addons to add. After getting this set up, you can do further upgrades, etc. of the addon using xxe's addon manager.
