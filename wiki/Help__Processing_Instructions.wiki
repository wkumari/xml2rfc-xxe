= Processing Instructions =

Although support for editing and inserting <?rfc include=?> processing instructions more easily is planned, support for handling the file that is included is not - meaning that, for example, although cross-references to a reference in the included file now show as "included", the xxe validator will claim that the document doesn't validate.

xxe is by nature a "root element editor", not an XML file editor, so the ability to edit processing instructions that occur before the root <rfc> element is provided by custom java code. It supports editing any <?rfc ...?> PI before the root element; it provides a dropdown box for PIs that it knows about but the PI name can be typed in if the dropdown box doesn't contain the desired element name. Although PIs with multiple pseudo-attributes can not be edited, they will not be damaged. For example, <?rfc toc="yes" toccompact="no"?>&#8212;this will appear in the editor the same as <?rfc toc="yes">.

In addition, the `Edit in...` menu option facilitates editing these items in another editor.
